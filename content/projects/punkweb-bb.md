## 📖 Overview

PunkwebBB is an open-source (BSD-3 Clause) bulletin board system for Django. It is ideal for a wide variety of online communities and discussion platforms. I developed it to provide a simple and customizable forum solution for Django applications. Whether you're building a niche interest group or a large-scale community, PunkwebBB offers the flexibility and features needed to support engaging discussions.

## 🎯 Goals & Challenges

**Goals:**

- Be easy to install and integrate with existing Django projects
- Provide essential forum features out-of-the-box
- Simple to configure and extend
- Support BBCode and Markdown formatting
- Have a modern, responsive UI with client-side interactivity such as modals
- Standalone - do not require adding any other `INSTALLED_APP`s

**Challenges:**

- Ensure true WYSIWYG content editing experience with both BBCode and Markdown
- Support real-time features like shoutbox
- Fine-grained role-based permissions

## 🧠 Approach & Implementation

I built PunkwebBB because I wanted to a Django forum solution that was truly standalone and easy to integrate into any Django project. By standalone I mean not requiring users to add any additional apps to their `INSTALLED_APPS` other than PunkwebBB itself. I kept all functionality self-contained within the PunkwebBB app by using lower-level python packages rather than existing Django app alternatives. I used Django's built-in authentication system to manage users and permissions, ensuring compatibility with existing user models.

## 📊 Results & Impact

While PunkwebBB has not yet seen widespread adoption, it has received interest from Django developers seeking a lightweight forum solution. The project is stable but continues to receive updates some-what regularly. It remains as my most starred open-source project on GitHub. Future plans include adding more configuration options and improving documentation.

## 🧭 Lessons Learned

I learned a lot about building reusable Django apps through this project. Keeping the app truly standalone required careful consideration of dependencies and architecture. I also gained experience with the Django permissions framework. Leveraging HTMX allowed me to add interactivity without the complexity of a full frontend framework, which was a valuable lesson in simplicity. Overall, PunkwebBB reinforced the importance of clear documentation and ease of use when creating open-source software.
