## Overview

Brief summary (2–4 sentences) describing:

- What the project is
- Who it was for (if applicable)
- The primary problem it solves
- Your role and scope of involvement

_Example:_

> A web platform for managing small business operations, allowing owners to track sales, inventory, and customer data. I led full-stack development, from data modeling to UI design and deployment.

## Goals & Challenges

Outline the project’s main goals and any notable challenges or constraints.

**Goals:**

- Modern, responsive UI
- Fast CRUD interactions
- Scalable backend structure

**Challenges:**

- Limited client budget and short timeline
- Complex relationships between entities
- Handling real-time updates efficiently

---

## Approach & Implementation

Explain how you approached the project. This section should show your reasoning, not just what you built.

- Architecture decisions (e.g., why Django + React)
- Key integrations or libraries used
- Notable patterns or abstractions
- Backend structure overview
- Any automation or optimization efforts

_Example:_

> I chose Django REST Framework for its robust authentication and serialization. On the frontend, React Query handled data fetching and caching efficiently. Components were built modularly with Tailwind for rapid iteration.

## Key Features

List the most notable features — ideally user-facing, but technical ones are fine too.

- User authentication with JWT
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Image uploads to Firebase Storage
- Admin interface for content management
- SEO-optimized public pages

---

## Technical Highlights

Show off a few details that set your implementation apart — performance tricks, clever patterns, or integrations.

- Used `prefetch_related` and query optimization to reduce DB hits by 70%.
- Implemented dynamic sitemap generation with Django’s sitemap framework.
- Added CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions with staging deploys.

## Results & Impact

Quantify where possible — metrics, outcomes, or qualitative feedback.

- Improved page load speed from 2.5s → 1.1s
- Reduced client’s manual reporting time by 50%
- Helped secure client’s first 100 paying customers
- Featured on Product Hunt (optional)

## Lessons Learned

Reflect on what you took away from the project — technical or process-based.

_Example:_

> I learned to balance technical ambition with pragmatic constraints. Early architecture planning saved time later, and using TypeScript would have prevented minor runtime bugs.
