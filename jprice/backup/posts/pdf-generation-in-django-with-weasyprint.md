This post covers how to build PDF documents with HTML and CSS and return them as regular Django views using [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/). You can use this technique to generate invoices, reports, resumes, or any other document that needs to be presented in a printable format. You can pass Django template context, use the [Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/templates/#the-django-template-language), use static files, and style the document with CSS, just like a regular web page.

In this tutorial, I will assume you have a basic understanding of Django, including views, templates, static files, and URL routing.

## Background / Concepts

Explain the underlying concept:

- The Django feature, principle, or problem area
- Common pitfalls or misconceptions
- Relation to broader web development patterns (MVC, REST, ORM, etc.)

Use examples if possible:

```python
# Example: defining a simple model
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

## Implementation / Tutorial

Show the practial implementation step-by-step.

### 1. Setup

Describe any setup or configuration required (e.g., installing packages, updating settings.py).

```bash
pip install django-widget-tweaks
```

### 2. Code Example

Provide code with explanations.

```python
# Example view
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, "books/list.html", {"books": books})
```

Explain what’s happening and why.

### 3. Templates or Frontend Integration (if applicable)

Include snippets using Django template syntax or HTMX/React integrations.

{% for book in books %}

  <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
{% endfor %}

## Common Issues & Debugging

Highlight frequent errors or gotchas:

- Example: “Why is my static file not loading?”
- Include short fixes and explanations.

## Best Practices

Offer insights like:

- Security considerations (CSRF, permissions)
- Performance tips (query optimization, caching)
- Maintainability (use of mixins, DRY patterns)
