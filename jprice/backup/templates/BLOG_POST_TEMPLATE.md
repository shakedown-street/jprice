## Introduction

Briefly introduce:

- What this post covers
- Why it matters in a Django context
- Any assumptions or prerequisites (e.g., familiarity with Django basics, Python 3.x, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Background / Concepts

Explain the underlying concept:

- The Django feature, principle, or problem area
- Common pitfalls or misconceptions
- Relation to broader web development patterns (MVC, REST, ORM, etc.)

Use examples if possible:

```python
# Example: defining a simple model
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

## Implementation / Tutorial

Show the practial implementation step-by-step.

### 1. Setup

Describe any setup or configuration required (e.g., installing packages, updating settings.py).

```bash
pip install django-widget-tweaks
```

### 2. Code Example

Provide code with explanations.

```python
# Example view
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, "books/list.html", {"books": books})
```

Explain what’s happening and why.

### 3. Templates or Frontend Integration (if applicable)

Include snippets using Django template syntax or HTMX/React integrations.

{% for book in books %}

  <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
{% endfor %}

## Common Issues & Debugging

Highlight frequent errors or gotchas:

- Example: “Why is my static file not loading?”
