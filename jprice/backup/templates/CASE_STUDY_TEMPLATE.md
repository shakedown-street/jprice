## 📖 Overview

Brief summary (2–4 sentences) describing:

- What the project is
- Who it was for (if applicable)
- The primary problem it solves
- Your role and scope of involvement

## 🧠 Approach & Implementation

Explain how you approached the project. This section should show your reasoning, not just what you built.

- Architecture decisions (e.g., why Django + React)
- Key integrations or libraries used
- Notable patterns or abstractions
- Backend structure overview
- Any automation or optimization efforts

_Example:_

> I chose Django REST Framework for its robust authentication and serialization. On the frontend, React Query handled data fetching and caching efficiently. Components were built modularly with Tailwind for rapid iteration.
